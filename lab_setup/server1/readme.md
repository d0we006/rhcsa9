# Server 1 Setup
## Server Specs
- CPU: 2
- Memory: 2GB
- Storage: 32GB
- NIC: 2
  - 1 NAT for internet access
  - 1 Local Host for machine and other server access
- OS: RHEL 9.0 Minimal Install

## Software
- Install httpd and break it to perform firewall and SELinux tasks
```
dnf install -y httpd

vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and change Listen 80 to Listen 85

echo "RHCSA is Awesome" > /var/www/html/file1

cal > /var/www/html/file2

echo "This file is totally messed up" > /var/www/html/file3

chcon -t default_t /var/www/html/file3

systemctl enable httpd
```

Remember to remove the repo configuration and network config after installing httpd so that the server is ready for the tasks. I found it easier to just mount the DVD and install httpd from there. Then all I had to do was remove the repo file and the mount point for the DVD.
